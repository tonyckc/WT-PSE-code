# Learning Robust Shape Regularization for Generalizable Medical Image Segmentation

[//]: # (**[Warning] The method suffers from the overfitting issue. We will re-evaluate our NAC-UE on the OpenOOD v1.5 and update the code and arxiv ASAP.**)

This is the official PyTorch implementation of our paper, coined [Learning Robust Shape Regularization for Generalizable Medical Image Segmentation]. If you have any problems, please email me (ck.ee@my.cityu.edu.hk or cs.ckc96@gmail.com).
